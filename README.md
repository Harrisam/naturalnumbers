naturalnumbers
==============

I made an error and went straight to coding with out testing. so next one with be done via rspec


the goal was to If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
